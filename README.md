# ce04 Exceptions

## Prerequisite Knowledge

* Basic knowledge of Java exceptions, including use of `try`-`catch`, `throw`, and `throws`.
* Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions

## Questions

In your notes, clearly answer the following questions. These instructions assume that you are 
logged into the Nike server. 

**NOTE:** If a step requires you to enter in a command, please provide in your notes the full 
command that you typed to make the related action happen. If context is necessary (e.g., the 
command depends on your present working directory), then please note that context as well.

### SECTION TITLE

1. Use Git to clone the repository for this exercise onto Nike into a subdirectory called `cs1302-ce04`:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-ce04.git
   ```

1. Change into the `cs1302-ce04` directory that was just created and look around. There should be
multiple Java files somewhere in the directory structure. 

   * What are the fully qualified names for the classes contained in those files?
   * What is the path to the default package for source code relative to the `cs1302-ce04`
     directory?

1. From the `cs1302-ce04` directory, try to compile each Java file separately. Note, there ares
   some dependencies between the Java files--therefore the order in which you compile them matters.
   For each compile-time error, do the following:

   * In what file is the error?
   * On what line in the source code is the error?
   * How does Java describe the error?
   * Fix that specific error. There may be other problems with the code, but do not fix them at this time.
     What did you do to fix it?
